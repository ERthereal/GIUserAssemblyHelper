# GIUserAssemblyHelper
UA helper for the anime game `Go: Impossible`.

Note: This program doesn't have write feature, because it's useless after the 33.0 version of the certain anime game.

I suggest you to read [this tutorial](https://github.com/YYHEggEgg/GIUserAssemblyHelper/blob/main/Tutorial.md) to understand what the project is doing. [Chinese version](https://github.com/YYHEggEgg/GIUserAssemblyHelper/blob/main/Tutorial_CN.md)
